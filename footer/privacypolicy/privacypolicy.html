      <p class="privacypolicy-p mt-3">We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>

It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.</p>

      <p class="privacypolicy-p mt-1">For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
      <p class="privacypolicy-p mt-1">In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us.
